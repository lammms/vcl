<h3 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to Visualizing Caribbean Literature</h3>

<br>


Writing in and about the Caribbean has been documented across anthologies, bibliographies and critical analyses. In the spaces where Caribbean literary studies and digital humanities meet, there has already been rich exploration of Caribbean literary history. This project builds on existing work in Caribbean digital literary studies, including [In the Same Boats][1], [Caribbean Literary Heritage][2] and the 2020 effort of [The Caribbean Digital VII][3] to create a database of [Caribbean digital scholarship][4], collectively annotate the works of Aimé Césaire and produce a generative collection of keywords that inform the constellation of Caribbean Studies.

Visualizing Caribbean Literature aims to contribute to and open the way for further critical engagement with Caribbean literary history, including teaching of literature in primary and secondary contexts.  Moreover, WRS adds the dimension of the literary reception as a key component for visualizing the breadth and depth of Caribbean communities.
