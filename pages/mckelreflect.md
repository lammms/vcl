            Working on the Digital Humanities project which was being issued by Create Caribbean was a very eventful and demanding experience. Trying to balance doing school work and working on the project was hard at first but after a while, I got accustomed and adapted to doing both. Another difficult task was trying to keep up with the deadline Dr. Esprit set for us. But with perseverance and putting enough hours into doing the work I was able to keep on track with the deadlines. <div class="acreadmore">  <a href="#" target="_blank">Read more</a></div>
