            During my first year at the Dominica State College, I joined the Create Caribbean Research Institute. As an intern, I attended the necessary digital humanities course. There I was exposed to digital humanities, a subject I previously knew nothing about. The other interns and myself would have classes twice a week with our lecturer, Dr. Schuyler Esprit. In these classes we learn very valuable information. We were exposed to the way digital humanists think and act and the work that they carry out. Furthermore we were exposed to numerous digital humanities tools which aid in research. <div class="acreadmore">  <a href="#" target="_blank">Read more</a></div>
