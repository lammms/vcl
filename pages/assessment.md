Create Caribbean interns enrolled in HIS115 for the academic year 2021-22 contributed to this project by working to develop a multimedia resource documenting Caribbean literary history, particularly with a searchable, annotated, and mapped timeline of Caribbean literature from 1800 – the present.

Their assessment is based on the following areas of contribution, as presented to them in the course outline:

1)	Intern contributions and tasks: 150 points (Intern Time Sheet Log)

Each of you will contribute to various tasks toward the development of the project (assigned weekly) during your intern hours. You may be required to contribute small tasks to a larger task where your teammates will be relying on your contribution to move the project forward. You may also be assigned to tasks as smaller groups and may have to make decisions on your own about the division of labour.

2)	Individual ‘project’: 250 points

You will design a small digital humanities project using a single tool or set of tools based on one of a topic or data set of your choosing under the WRS umbrella. This project will appear on a page dedicated to student projects and will be publicly available when the main project is published.

3)	Official Reflection on the process: 50 points

This will be a short essay reflecting on your process of project development including an account of your contributions and tasks for the main project and your rationale for selecting your individual topic. You should also reflect on your points of collaboration and use of DH tools and methods. This reflection will also be part of

4)	Presentation: 100 points
