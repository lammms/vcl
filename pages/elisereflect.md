					Throughout the duration of my stay as a Create Caribbean Intern I have always felt like I was learning and growing in one way or another. In the HIS115 classes, I was educated about what Digital Humanities was, the reasoning behind studying this field, and the tools used to perform this task. The coursework was separated into bite-sized pieces that were easy to digest and the exposure to the programs and applications being learnt ensured memorable lessons. At times when we felt overwhelmed as students, we were given breaks to step away from the lesson, talk about our problems and receive advice. These sessions enabled me to truly learn that life was not only about completing schoolwork and assignments but also taking care of ourselves.
