            Initially, I had very little knowledge about Caribbean Literature. I only knew the basics seeing that I did literature in high school. In order to collect information for this project, lots of research, reading, data entry and fact checking had to be done. I had never done this type of research so it was a new experience. At times, this would be calming and at other times it would be frustrating. Doing this gave me skills such as data entry and collection skills and research skills. Some resources I used when working on the main project and my individual project were arcgis, zotero, worldcat, goodreads and amazon. <div class="acreadmore">  <a href="#" target="_blank">Read more</a></div>
