This project has truly been the embodiment of collaboration, DH pedagogy and project development at its best. The student interns in the 2020-22 and 2021-23 cohorts have been engaged, diligent and curious at every turn. Their individual projects can be viewed [here](https://commonsbox.createcaribbean.org).
